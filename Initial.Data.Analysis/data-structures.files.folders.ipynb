For now, you can just run the commands to see what ouput they generate. )\n\nHere we see a portion of the file system hierarchy.  The tree is made up of only two elements: directories ( aka folders ) and files.  Directories can contain other directories ( aka subdirectories ) and files.  In this example, directories are denoted by ending with a '/' symbol.  Here we have four directories: home, jovyan, Initial.Data.Analysis, and LinuxTerminal.  The home folder has a single child, jovyan, which itself has a number of children, including two subdirectories, Initial.Data.Analysis and LinuxTerminal.  The LinuxTerminal directory contains no subdirectories and has only a single file, Linux.Terminal.Setup.ipynb.\n\nNotice that the home directory is prefixed with a slash '/'.  This is the symbol for the root of the tree or the \"root\" directory. The slash is also the symbol used to delineate directories from subdirectories.
