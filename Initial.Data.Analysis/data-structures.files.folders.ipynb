The tree is made up of only two elements: directories ( aka folders ) and files.  Directories can contain other directories ( aka subdirectories ) and files.  In this example, directories are denoted by ending with a '/' symbol.  Here we have four directories: home, jovyan, Initial.Data.Analysis, and LinuxTerminal.  The home folder has a single child, jovyan, which itself has a number of children, including two subdirectories, Initial.Data.Analysis and LinuxTerminal.
